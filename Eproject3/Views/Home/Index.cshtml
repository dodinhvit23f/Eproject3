        James Thew is famous in Sweden and around the world thanks to head chef Magnus Nilsson. Voted among the worlds 50 best restaurants in 2012, Faviken is in north of Stockholm and offers accommodations for diners and travelers. As this location experiences long winters, Nilsson is able to get the best out of the long-stored vegetables and meat. He juggles himself from being a hunter, a fisherman, a farmer and an outstanding chef. Diners savor specialties like the 18 month-old scallops served (like most of the dishes) with wine. Nilsson has much to share in the culinary world and his innovations have opened doors to this part of Sweden were food enthusiasts cannot wait for a try.
